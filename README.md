# Demeter
Demeter (DEterMinistic nEutron Transport solvER) is a modern deterministic neutron transport code for reactor simulations. The code is d√©signed to perform 3D fixe source and eigenvalue calculations by solving the multi-group neutron transport equation.

Numerically, the physics part is coded in C++ with Python as a user interface for easy and fast utilisation. Cmake is used for build configurations. 



with a python interface for users application.
