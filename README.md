# Demeter
Demeter^1^ is a modern and open source deterministic neutron transport code for reactor simulations. The code is designed to perform 3D fixe source and eigenvalue calculations by solving the multi-group neutron transport equation.

Numerically, the physics part is coded in C++ with Python as a user interface for easy and fast utilisations. Cmake is used to build configurations.
