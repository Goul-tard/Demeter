# Demeter
Demeter<sup>1</sup> is a modern and open source deterministic neutron transport code for reactor simulations. The code is designed to perform 3D fixe source and eigenvalue calculations by solving the multi-group neutron transport equation.

Numerically, the physics part is coded in C++ with Python as a user interface for easy and fast utilisations. Cmake is used to build configurations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Choose a code style (Google style eg) and setup a linter.
- [ ] Setup Cmake (with [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html), MemorySanitizer, LeakSanitizer, ...).
- [ ] Run a simple main.cpp.
- [ ] Setup directory structure.
- [ ] Setup Github Action.
- [ ] Talk about doc style (eg doc string) and the way to generate it automatically.
- [ ] Talk about tests (use eg catch or gtest).
- [ ] Design a logo.
